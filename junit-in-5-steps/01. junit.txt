Introduction to Unit Testing with JUnit
	
	Large applications can have 1000s of code files and millions of lines of code
	
	Testing: Check app behavior against expected behavior 
	
		Option 1: Deploy the complete application and test
			THis is called System Testing or Integration Testing
			
		Option 2: Test specific units of application code independently
			
			Example: A specific method or group of methods 
			
			This is called Unit Testing
			
			Advantages of Unit Testing 
				
				Finds bug early (run under CI)
				Easy to fix bugs
				Reduces costs in the long run
			
			Most Popular Java Frameworks: JUnit and Mockito
		
		Recommended: Option 1 + Option 2

 Create a new java project 
 
 	Then create a java file in src - 
 	
 		package com.practice.junit;
		public class MyMath {
			
			public int calculateSum(int[] numbers) {
				int sum =0;
				
				for(int number:numbers) {
					sum+=number;
				}
				return sum;
			}
		}
 		
 	Then create a new Source Folder for writing Test cases, named test
 	
 	In test create JUnit test case
 	
 	While creating the test case, select New JUnit Jupiter test, which is version 5 of JUnit
